Wikipedia: Critical philosophy	Attributed to Immanuel Kant, the critical philosophy () movement sees the primary task of philosophy as criticism rather than justification of knowledge; criticism, for Kant, meant judging as to the possibilities of knowledge before advancing to knowledge itself (from the Greek kritike (techne), or "art of judgment"). The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories—including those about philosophy itself—to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.	attribut immanuel kant critic philosophi movement see primari task rather than justif knowledg meant judg possibl befor advanc itself from greek kritik techn art judgment basic philosoph accord view establish demonstr theori about realiti subject all includ those review measur valid how well withstand

The most prominent supporters of this hypothesis are Duesberg himself, biochemist and vitamin proponent David Rasnick, and journalist Celia Farber. The scientific community contends that Duesberg's arguments are the result of cherry-picking predominantly outdated scientific data and selectively ignoring evidence in favor of HIV's role in AIDS.

The audio signal is commonly recorded on a VTR track or other storage media.  The bits are encoded using the biphase mark code (also known as FM):  a 0 bit has a single transition at the start of the bit period.  A 1 bit has two transitions, at the beginning and middle of the period.  This encoding is self-clocking. Each frame is terminated by a 'sync word' which has a special predefined sync relationship with any video or film content.	linear longitudin timecod ltc encod smpte data audio signal defin 12m specif commonli record vtr track other storag media bit us biphas mark code also known fm 0 ha singl transit start period 1 two begin middl self clock each frame termin sync word which special predefin relationship ani video film content
